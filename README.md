### ETH Zurich Statistical Learning Theory

> Grade: 5.5/6.0

This is the assignment repository for Statistical Learning Theory in ETH Zurich when I was an exchange student there. There are in total 8 pieces of assignments, but I only did the first 7. The topics include:

| Exercise | Topic                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 1        | Locally Linear Embedding |
| 2        | Sampling                 |
| 3        | Deterministic Annealing  |
| 4        | Histogram Clustering     |
| 5        | Constant Shift Embedding |
| 6        | Pairwise Clustering      |
| 7        | Mean Field Approximation |
| 8        | Validation (skipped)     |
